Greenhouse Gas Emission Forecasting
This project forecasts UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over the next 5 years and assesses progress towards climate change goals using a time series model on public atmospheric emissions data.

Data
Dataset: UK ONS Atmospheric Emissions (1990-2021)
Granularity: GHG emissions amounts broken down annually by industry category
Focus Area: Total annual GHG emissions across all industries
Notebooks
Data Exploration & Visualization: Cleans data, explores trends in emissions over time, compares performance across industries
Modeling & Forecasting: Fits a timeseries model on historical data, evaluates accuracy, and generates 5 year projections
Methodology
Data Import & Cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis
Time Series Model Fitting
Model Evaluation
Forecasting
Recommendations & Analysis
Key Findings
Total GHG emission decreased at a slow linear rate from 1990-2021
Construction, Trade, and Real Estate industries increased emissions despite overall reduction
Forecast shows continued gradual emissions decline but not at pace needed to hit net zero 2050 targets
Recommendations
More aggressive policy measures required for UK to achieve legislated climate change goals based on current trajectory.
